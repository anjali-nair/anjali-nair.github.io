1. Correctly implemented:

Tufts CS website redirects here. 
Index.html, bio.html, and resume.html contain all required components and pass HTML5 specs, showing no errors. 
Index-style.css, bio-style.css, and resume-style.css are all verified, with no errors; both index-style and resume-style contain more than 5 rules.

2. Did not collaborate with anyone, but used guides and tutorials on w3schools.com to learn new styling/markup elements.

3. Probably a total of 10 hours, over a few days (not including the time it took to figure out git.)
