	<h1> Biography of Anjali Nair </h1>
	<p> Anjali really hates talking about herself – really – and prefers to remain an enigmatic presence in both virtual and non-virtual worlds. Here's a couple of things. She grew up in suburban New Jersey, spending her formative years staring out of windows and dreaming of things that children dream of. She is pretty into playing guitar and is always down to start new genre-non-specific bands with weird names. In college at Tufts University, she studies the brain, but has yet to find an explanation for her own. </p>
